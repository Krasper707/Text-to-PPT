## How It Works

This tool leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently structure raw text into a presentation format, and then uses `python-pptx` to apply the visual styling from a user-provided template.

1.  **Input:** The user provides a block of text, an AI Pipe token (a universal key for various LLMs), and their own `.pptx` template.
2.  **AI Structuring:** The application sends the text to the chosen LLM with a detailed prompt, requesting a structured JSON output. This JSON serves as a blueprint, defining the title, content, speaker notes, and even a visual suggestion for each slide.
3.  **Style Analysis:** The app analyzes the uploaded `.pptx` template to identify master slide layouts (e.g., "Title and Content", "Content with Image") and extracts a bank of reusable images from content placeholders.
4.  **Assembly:** It then programmatically builds a new presentation. Each new slide is created using the appropriate layout from the template, ensuring all fonts, colors, and logos are inherited perfectly. If the AI suggests a visual and images are available, it places a reused image. Text is automatically formatted, wrapped, and resized to fit.
5.  **Output:** The final, professionally styled `.pptx` file is provided for immediate download.
